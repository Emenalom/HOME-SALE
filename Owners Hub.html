            <h2>Our After Sales Service</h2>
            <p>Every care has been taken to ensure your home is ready for you, however, there can occasionally be some minor issues that only become apparent once the home is lived in. These are known as snags and are covered by the two year warranty.

                If you identify any snags, or believe something could be a snagging issue, please contact our New Home Customer Care team. They will log the details and either arrange for a repair, ask for photos to help diagnose the issue or in the event it’s more complex, they may arrange for somebody to come and inspect in order to confirm the next steps.
                
                Under normal circumstances, we expect to resolve most snags within 30 days. Where this is not possible, for example, due to ordering materials with a longer lead time, we will keep you regularly updated and confirm an anticipated date for the repair as soon as we can.
                
                At David Wilson Homes, we believe that everyone has the right to be safe, secure and respected whilst at work. If something hasn't gone to plan, please be patient and we'll do our best to help. We'd like to thank you in advance for showing respect, kindness and consideration to our teams as they work to provide a great service. Any aggressive or inappropriate behaviour towards our colleagues will not be tolerated.
                
                Should you wish to record or film one of our employees you must have their explicit consent. If a colleague is recorded or filmed and that recording or video is shared without individual consent we have the right to remove this from any social channels and take further action to protect our colleagues.</p>
